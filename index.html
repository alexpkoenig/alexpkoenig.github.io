			<h5 style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 20px; font-size: 24px">A bit about me...</h5>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 18px">Hello, I'm Alex! I currently study aerospace engineering and physics at MIT -- after a year or two of being torn between the two fields, I decided to tackle them both. I love space exploration, propulsion systems, experimental aircraft, optical engineering, and telescopes; you'll find examples of my projects and photos in the taskbar above. Outside of school & work, I also enjoy different kinds of exploration -- I'm an astrophotographer, wilderness backpacker, private pilot, cyclist, runner, windsurfer, sailor, SCUBA diver, and climber.

			<h6 style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 18px">ExoAnalytic Solutions Intern</h6>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 15px"><i>This fall I'm a full-time intern for ExoAnalytic. My work includes two projects: (1) assisting in developing an architecture for a satellite constellation intended to observe artificial satellites in cislunar space, including the relevant trade studies, cost analyses, and simulations; and (2) creating a high-level design for a company owned-and-built space telescope for providing space situational awareness to customers.</i></p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 15px"><i>I also interned at ExoAnalytic in Jan 2020. To guide ExoAnalytic's response to the space debris issue in LEO, I created a report recommending guiding features of a future space traffic management architecture. To inform my work, I took inspiration from contemporary efforts in aerospace as a whole (such as UAV integration into the national airspace system), and spoke with leading experts in the space traffic management field.</i></p>

			<h6 style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 18px">MIT Rocket Team: Liquid Propulsion Group Team Member</h6>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 15px"><i>Our primary goal in the liquid propulsion group this semester is to onboard and train a group of a dozen freshmen students, for which I have been developing and executing a propulsion and fluid dynamics curriculum with my team to get incoming freshmen up to speed. I expect to lead a group of 3-4 freshmen in either a theoretical propulsion design project or hands-on building project later this semester (specifics TBD). This semester we are also undergoing design work for new regeneratively-cooled liquid engine, including thermal analysis studies, optimization studies, structural analysis, and fluids system design.</i></p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 15px"><i>In previous semesters on the liquid propulsion group, we designed and built a 400 lbf. lox+ethanol engine. We have yet to test this system due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but we are all looking forward to doing so to as soon as possible. My specific work included envisioning and manufacturing the engine chamber and nozzle; designing, building, and tested ignition system, and creating fluids system and test stand components.</i></p>
			
			<h5 style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 24px">What I've done</h5>
			<h6 style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 18px">DaSH PA Human-Powered Airplane Team Member</h6>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 15px"><i>DaSH PA is a 50 kg, 33-meter-wingspan human-powered airplane created by a team of volunteers in the SF Bay Area. I joined the team in 2017 and focused on the fabrication of lower-weight components for the plane, including a new propellor, fuselage fairing, and wing sections. The pinnacle of my experience on the team was when we drove the plane down to the deserts in Southern California to perform flight testing in the winter of 2018. During that memorable week, I saw the components I created successfully flown on several flights. Over the course of my time on the project, I acquired skills in low-weight & high-efficiency airplane design, learned to work with carbon fiber components, and gained my first real-world experience on an engineering team.</i></p>

			<h6 style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 18px">General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Intern</h6>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 15px"><i>In Jan 2019 I joined the effort at General Atomics to pave the way for integrating unmanned aerial vehicles into the national airspace system. Our team's goal was to demonstrate the ability of large UAVs to safely operate within controlled, heavily-trafficked airspace, including avoiding manned traffic, engaging in two-way communication with ATC, and performing collision avoidance maneuvers. I focused on the development of a particular cross-country flight demonstration at the heart of the effort, which involved creating risk mitigation methods for the flight, and writing the flight demo CONOPS -- one of the key deliverables for the collaborating NASA UAS-NAS group in order to receive a flight waiver from the FAA. Through the course of my internship, I learned how policy and technical considerations interplay at the cutting edge of aerospace efforts.</i></p>

			<h6 style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 18px">MIT Dept. of Planetary Sciences Undergraduate Researcher</h6>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 15px"><i>My research focused on possible physical traces left in the Oort Cloud by historical gravitational interactions between Oort Cloud objects and stellar flybys. This research is of interest to those who wish to understand possible origins of long-period comets and interstellar objects such as I1/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua) and  2I/2019 Q4 (Borisov). In my work, I utilized Gaia astrometrical data to identify historical stellar flybys, and wrote code (mostly Python, but also utilized C) to perform n-body gravitational simulations. I analyzed the simulation outputs to determine likely traces in the phase space of Oort Cloud objects, and derived correlated error terms to validate my results.</i></p>

			<h6 style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 18px">MIT Space Systems Lab Undergraduate Researcher</h6>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 15px"><i>MIT SSL has been developing a remote sensing 3U cubesat telescope capable of achieving higher resolution than is typical for an aperture compact enough for such a small form factor, which is a key consideration in low-cost remote sensing systems. This cubesat (dubbed the SpinAp Telescope) features 30 cm x 10 cm rectangular mirrors that unfold into place in orbit, which then spin so as to emulate a full 70 cm diameter circular aperture in terms of resolution. The dynamics of pointing and slewing a rapidly-rotating telescope pose a unique challenge, however; the work of my group (several freshmen at the time) was to prepare the testbed system for dynamics testing in the lab by proceduralizing the balancing of the testbed on the air bearing, validating gyroscopic and motor control, and providing documentation and training for the test setup. We also began initial work on dynamics testing, for which I created a GUI to provide orientation/spinning control of the testbed system.</i></p>
